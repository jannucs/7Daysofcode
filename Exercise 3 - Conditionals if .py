#Using an if statement to control your code:

if True:
    print(1)
if 1 == 1:
    print(2)
    print(3)

#Combining multiple conditions:

if 3 > 1 and 'data == data':
    print('Both conditions are true!')  
if 10 < 20 or 4 <= 5:
    print('At least one condition is true.')

#Building more complex if statements:

if (20 > 3 and 2 != 1) or 'Games' == 'Games':
    print('At least one condition is true.')

#Using the else clause:

if False:
    print(1)
else:
    print('The condition above was false.')

#Using the elif clause:

if False:
    print(1)
elif 30 > 5:
    print('The condition above was false.')
